## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up a PostgreSQL user

If you don't have a user set on postgres, here's how to set new user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -s [username]
```

To set a password for this user, log in to the PostgreSQL command line client:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Enter the following command to set the password:

```bash
\password your_password
```

Enter and confirm the password. Then exit the PostgreSQL client:

```bash
\q
```

## üìã Execution

Run the following commands to execute locally:

The following will install required version of ruby (make sure [rvm is installed](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).)

```bash
rvm use 2.7.2
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuzerShakir/rails-authenticate.git
```

```bash
cd rails-authenticate
```

```bash
bundle install
```

#### üí° Imp Note:

To successfully create development and test database, you will need to update `config.database.yml` file with correct postgresql username and password.
To edit the it without exposing your credentials, give the following command:

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

_`code` for Visual Studio Code_
_`subl` for sublime_

This will open `credential.yml` file and enter credential as follows in it:

```
database:
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
```

Hit `ctrl + s` to save and then close the `credential.yml` file from the editor. This will save the credentials. To check if it did save, run the following inside rails console:

```
Rails.application.credentials.dig(:database, :username)
```

```bash
rails db:create
```

Also `.env` file has been added to `.gitignore` file. You should create a similar file named `.env` at the root of this directory and fill the following environment variables value with yours:

```
GMAIL_USERNAME = your_email
GMAIL_PASSWORD = your_password
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = your_key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY = your_secret_key
```

```bash
rails s
```
